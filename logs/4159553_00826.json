Hunnicutt, a resident of said County and State, aged Sixty Nine years, who being first duly sworn according to law, doth on his oath make the following declaration, in order to obtain the benefit of the Act of Congress passed June 7th, 1832:\n\nThat he entered the service of the United States under the following named officers, and served as herein stated:\n\nHe volunteered his services in the North Carolina Militia, in the year 1780 or 1781, as a private man, under Captain James Fletcher, who belonged to Colonel Grants Regiment. He marched from his home in Johnston County, to Cross Creek (now Fayetteville) where he was stationed several months - during which time he was engaged in building Fort Williams; afterwards he marched with the same Company and Officers to Wilmington, where they were stationed some time as a guard over prisoners. He does not recollect the time of his discharge from said service, but thinks it was about the year 1782 or 1783; he never received any written discharge, nor has he any record of his services.\n\nHe further declares that he has no property, except a house and lot valued at about Two Hundred Dollars - which is not enough to support him; and that during the Revolutionary War he was a farmer and resided in Johnston County, North Carolina, where he has lived ever since, engaged in agricultural pursuits.\n\nHe hereby relinquishes every claim to a pension or annuity except the present, and declares that his name is not on the pension roll of any agency in any State.\n\nSworn to and subscribed the day and year aforesaid.\n\nJohn W. Hunnicutt\n\nWe John S. McLelland and Jas. A. McLelland, Clerks of the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Johnston County, do hereby certify that John W. Hunnicutt, who is personally known to us, signed his name to us, after being duly sworn, and that we believe him to be Sixty Nine years of age.\n\nIn testimony whereof, we have hereunto subscribed our names and affixed the seal of said Court, at Smithfield, this 21st day of October A.D. 1832.\n\nJno S.
