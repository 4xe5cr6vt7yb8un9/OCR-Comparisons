My father was named Edward Barnett, my mother\u2019s maiden name was Elizabeth Johnson, both of whom were natives of Maryland.\n\nI enlisted in the Army of the United States at Baltimore County Maryland in the year 1792 for three years or during the war in Captain John Conn\u2019s Company of Infantry commanded by Colo. Symmes - I served as a private in said Company, and was discharged from the service at Fort Washington near Cincinnati Ohio in the fall of the year 1795.\n\nMy first tour of duty after enlistment was to go with a detachment under command of Capt John Conn to Pittsburgh Pa where we arrived in about three weeks, thence by flat boats down the Ohio river to Fort Washington - this tour occupied about six weeks. I remained at Fort Washington two months when I was ordered on a tour of duty to Marietta Ohio for the purpose of protecting the inhabitants from the Indians who were hostile and troublesome at that time - we had several skirmishes with them, but no regular engagements while I was in service - The Company under command of Capt John Conn remained at Marietta about six months when they returned to Fort Washington where I remained until discharged.\n\nI hereby relinquish every claim whatever to a pension or annuity except the present, and declare that my name is not on the pension roll of any agency in any state -\n\nSworn to and subscribed the day and year first above written\nJoseph Barnett\n\nWe J.W. Hunter & James Frazier residents of Anderson township in the County aforesaid, hereby certify that we are well acquainted with Joseph Barnett who has subscribed and sworn to the above declaration, that we believe him to be Eighty two years of age, that he is reputed and believed in the community where he resides to have been a soldier of the Revolution, and that we concur in that opinion -\n\nSworn to and subscribed the day and year first above written\nJ.W.
