# OCR-Comparisons

Tasks:

 * Make a github repository
 * Gather a testing dataset
 * Start building an ipython notebook to test Anthropic or GPT-4
 * BONUS: Test with Anthropic AND GPT-4
 

Dataset: We will be using documents from the [Revolutionary War Pension Files](https://www.archives.gov/citizen-archivist/missions/revolutionary-war-pension-files) hosted by the National Archive.  I have attached the JSON files with some examples. I would start with hand selecting 10-20 files and get to a total of 100 pages or more. 

 
Initial Comparison:

 * Textract (I’ll build this one so don’t worry about it focus on the LLMs)
 * Anthropic
 * GPT-4/o
 * A model from huggingface (Yesterday Microsoft released a new VQA model you can find it here) You should be able to run it locally using your CPU or GPU if you have enough VRAM if you can’t we can discuss other options.
